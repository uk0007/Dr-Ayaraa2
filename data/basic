An Ayurvedic doctor is a practitioner of Ayurveda, an ancient Indian system of medicine that emphasizes holistic health through natural remedies, diet, and lifestyle changes. To become one, you typically need a Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery (BAMS) degree, which involves over five years of study including both Ayurvedic principles and modern medical science. During a visit, an Ayurvedic doctor will use methods like pulse, tongue, and nail examination, along with patient history, to diagnose imbalances and recommend treatments like herbal medicines, diet adjustments, panchakarma (detoxification procedures), and yoga.
